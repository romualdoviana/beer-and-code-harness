# init:database-schema

You are helping a developer turn a **project description** and its **user stories** into a **suggested database schema** written in **DBML** (Database Markup Language). This document is the third artifact of the project spec. It builds directly on the first two and becomes the reference the team uses to write migrations and models.

Optional focus or extra context from the developer (may be empty):

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Your goal

Read the existing project description and user stories, then produce a single document at **`.spec/init/database-schema.md`** that:

1. Models every **entity** implied by the core concepts and stories as a DBML `Table`.
2. Defines **columns** with concrete types, nullability, defaults, and uniqueness.
3. Declares **relationships** (foreign keys) and the **lookup tables** that back every categorical field.
4. Follows the **conventions of the detected stack** (framework/ORM from the project description) and the universal DB guidelines below.

## Process

### 1. Read the source of truth first

Before asking anything, read **`.spec/init/project-description.md`** and **`.spec/init/user-stories.md`**. These are the inputs to this command.

- If either file is missing, stop and tell the developer to run `init:project-description` and/or `init:user-stories` first.
- Extract: the core concepts (the nouns → tables), the workflows and stories (the fields, states, and relationships), the user types (auth/roles), and any limits or numbers stated (→ column constraints).
- Extract the **framework and ORM** from the project description's Tech Stack section — they drive the naming conventions below. Confirm against the codebase manifest (`composer.json`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Gemfile`, …) when one exists.
- Also scan any other files already under `.spec/` for schema decisions already made, and inspect the project for an existing schema (migrations directory, ORM models/entities, `schema.prisma`, `*.sql` files) so you extend rather than contradict what's there.

Match the **language** of the project description for prose and comments (keep table/column identifiers in English, snake_case).

Then verify the chain is internally fresh — line 3 of each generated artifact records the inputs it was built from:

```bash
# prints nothing when fresh; any output = an input changed after user-stories was generated
for pair in $(sed -n '3p' .spec/init/user-stories.md | grep -oE '[a-z0-9.-]+\.md@sha256:[0-9a-f]{12}'); do
  [ "$(sha256sum ".spec/init/${pair%%@*}" | cut -c1-12)" = "${pair##*:}" ] \
    || echo "stale: user-stories.md predates current ${pair%%@*}"
done
```

Any output → warn the developer ("input changed after this artifact was generated — review before proceeding") and suggest re-running `init:user-stories` first. Warn and proceed if the developer chooses; never block. A file without a line-3 stamp predates this mechanism — nothing to verify.

### If the target file already exists (re-run)

Re-running this command must **update** the existing document, never rebuild it from scratch — `.spec` belongs to the developer, and manual edits there are decisions, not noise.

- Read the existing `.spec/init/database-schema.md` **before** interviewing. Every decision recorded in it (tables, columns, seeds, notes) is source of truth.
- Interview only about **deltas**: new concepts or stories since the last run, new gaps, contradictions. Never re-ask what the document already answers.
- Update via **Edit**, not a full rewrite. Keep tables and columns the developer added or edited; extend the DBML block in place. Renaming or dropping an existing table requires explicit developer confirmation — `project-phases` references tables by name in its coverage check.
- A table, column, or note the developer deleted stays deleted — restore it only if the developer explicitly confirms.

Line 3 of the existing file is its **input stamp** (see step 3). Verify it before interviewing:

```bash
# prints nothing when fresh; any output = that input changed after this document was generated
for pair in $(sed -n '3p' .spec/init/database-schema.md | grep -oE '[a-z0-9.-]+\.md@sha256:[0-9a-f]{12}'); do
  [ "$(sha256sum ".spec/init/${pair%%@*}" | cut -c1-12)" = "${pair##*:}" ] \
    || echo "stale: ${pair%%@*} changed after this document was generated"
done
```

Any output → warn the developer ("input changed after this artifact was generated — review before proceeding") and focus the delta interview on what changed in that input. Warn and proceed; never block. A file without a line-3 stamp predates this mechanism — nothing to verify.

### 2. Interview to close gaps

Derive as much of the schema as you can directly from the docs, then find what's undefined. Ask the developer only about gaps that change the shape of the schema — do not interrogate on things the docs already answer. Focus on:

- **Cardinality** — one-to-many vs many-to-many; where a pivot table is needed.
- **Ownership & tenancy** — who owns a record; whether data is scoped per user/team/tenant.
- **Soft deletes vs hard deletes** — which entities need `deleted_at`.
- **Categorical fields** — every status/type/category/priority/role → which values seed the lookup table.
- **Uniqueness & required fields** — which columns are `unique`, which are `not null`.

Use `AskUserQuestion` for discrete decisions with clear options. The developer answers in a terminal with nothing else on screen, so every question stands alone: say **what is being decided** in plain words (never an id or a doc key as the subject), **quote the evidence** you are working from (or name the gap when nothing is written), say **why you are asking**, and say **what changes** depending on the answer. Give 2–4 options that are real answers, never a bare yes/no: `label` ≤ 5 words naming the choice, `description` spelling out its consequence — what gets written into the document, what it costs, what it rules out. Recommended option first, marked `(Recomendado)`, with the reason in its description; never add an “Other” option, the harness supplies it. Ask real open questions in plain text when the answer is not a menu, with the same structure plus one worked example of a valid answer. Batch related questions (≤ 4 per call); don't drip one at a time. When something stays undecided, mark it as an open question rather than inventing a column.

### 3. Write the document

Write to `.spec/init/database-schema.md` (create the `.spec/init/` directories if missing). The file is Markdown that wraps a single DBML code block plus supporting notes. Use **exactly** this structure:

````markdown
# <Project Name> — Database Schema

<!-- inputs: project-description.md@sha256:<first 12 chars> user-stories.md@sha256:<first 12 chars> -->

## Overview

<1–2 paragraphs: the data model at a glance — the main entities and how they connect. Bold the key entities. Note the conventions in force (detected framework/ORM, lookup tables for enums, soft deletes where used).>

## Schema (DBML)

```dbml
// Lookup tables first, then domain tables, then pivots.

Table statuses {
  id bigint [pk, increment]
  name varchar [not null]
  slug varchar [unique, not null]
  description text [null]
  is_active boolean [not null, default: true]
  created_at timestamp
  updated_at timestamp
}

Table users {
  id bigint [pk, increment]
  name varchar [not null]
  email varchar [unique, not null]
  avatar_path varchar [null]
  status_id bigint [ref: > statuses.id, not null]
  created_at timestamp
  updated_at timestamp
  deleted_at timestamp [null]
}

// ... one Table per entity, one Table per lookup, pivots for many-to-many
```

## Relationships

<Bullet list summarizing each relationship in plain language: "A **user** has many **projects**", "A **project** belongs to one **status**", "**users** and **roles** are many-to-many via **role_user**". One line per relationship.>

## Lookup Table Seeds

<For each lookup table, list the initial rows that should be seeded (the values that would otherwise be enum cases). Table name → the concrete values.>

## Notes & Conventions

<Bullets calling out: tables using soft deletes, pivots, indexes worth adding, any denormalization, and anything traceable to a specific user story or limit.>
````

Rules for the document:

- **Title** = project name + `— Database Schema`.
- **Line 3** is the machine-owned **input stamp**: `<!-- inputs: project-description.md@sha256:<12 chars> user-stories.md@sha256:<12 chars> -->`, each checksum being `sha256sum <file> | cut -c1-12` over the files as read in step 1. Refresh it on **every** run, including re-run Edits — downstream commands use it to detect drift. Never preserve a stale stamp as a "developer edit".
- The DBML must be valid: every `ref` points at a real `table.column`; every foreign key column exists on its table.
- Keep every table traceable to a core concept, workflow, or story. No invented entities — if you need one to make a relationship work, note why.
- If gaps remain unresolved, add a short `## Open Questions` section at the end. Otherwise omit it.

## DB Guidelines

### Stack conventions (detect, then apply)

Apply the naming and column conventions of the **framework/ORM detected in step 1** — table naming, primary key shape, foreign key naming, timestamp columns, join/pivot table naming, soft-delete column. Follow that stack's documented defaults (e.g. Eloquent, ActiveRecord, Django ORM, Prisma, TypeORM, GORM, Ecto). Never mix conventions from two stacks in one schema.

When no framework/ORM is detected, use this default profile:

- Table names **plural, snake_case** (`projects`, `project_attachments`). Join/pivot names are the two singular table names **alphabetically ordered, snake_case** (`role_user`, not `user_role`).
- Every table has `id bigint [pk, increment]` unless it's a pivot with a composite key.
- Foreign keys are `<singular>_id` (`user_id`, `status_id`) typed `bigint`.
- Include `created_at` and `updated_at timestamp` on domain tables. Add `deleted_at timestamp [null]` where the entity uses soft deletes.

### Enums & Lookup Tables (universal — any stack)

- **Do not use enum DB fields or string-based enum columns.**
- For any field that represents a set of predefined values (status, type, category, priority, role, level, etc.), **always create a lookup/auxiliary table** with a foreign key relationship.
  - Instead of a `status` string/enum column, create a `statuses` table (`id`, `name`, …) and reference it as `status_id` (foreign key).
  - The lookup table includes `id`, `name`, and optionally `slug`, `description`, `is_active`, and timestamps as needed.
  - Applies to **all** categorical/enumerable fields: statuses, types, categories, priorities, levels, domain roles, etc.

### File / Image Uploads (universal — any stack)

- Store the file path as a **string column** directly in the table (e.g. `avatar_path`, `document_path`, `attachment_path`).
- Use a descriptive `_path` suffix to signal it holds a file path.
- If a record can have **multiple** files, create a related table (e.g. `project_attachments`) with a `file_path` string column and a foreign key to the parent.

### 4. Coverage check (key concepts → tables)

Every Key Concept in the project description must be either persisted by the schema or explicitly declared not persisted. List the concepts mechanically:

```bash
grep -E '^- \*\*[^*]+:\*\*' .spec/init/project-description.md
```

For each concept, name the table(s) that persist it, or record it as **not persisted** with a one-line reason in `## Notes & Conventions` (e.g. derived at runtime, lives in config, out of MVP). A concept with no table and no note is a gap: add the table or the note before closing out.

Build the coverage table for the close-out report:

| Key Concept | Table(s) |
|-------------|----------|
| <Concept> | users, user_profiles |
| <Concept> | — not persisted: <reason> |

### 5. Self-checks (run until green)

After writing, run these checks. Any failure → fix the document via Edit and re-run until all pass. Never report completion with a failing check.

```bash
F=.spec/init/database-schema.md
test -f "$F"
head -1 "$F" | grep -qE '^# .+ — Database Schema$'
# line 3 input stamp present and fresh
[ "$(sed -n '3p' "$F")" = "<!-- inputs: project-description.md@sha256:$(sha256sum .spec/init/project-description.md | cut -c1-12) user-stories.md@sha256:$(sha256sum .spec/init/user-stories.md | cut -c1-12) -->" ]
grep -Fq '## Schema (DBML)' "$F"
grep -q '^```dbml' "$F"
grep -Fq '## Relationships' "$F"
grep -Fq '## Lookup Table Seeds' "$F"
grep -Fq '## Notes & Conventions' "$F"
[ "$(grep -cE '^Table [a-z0-9_]+ \{' "$F")" -ge 1 ]     # >=1 table declared
! grep -iqE '^ +[a-z0-9_]+ +enum' "$F"                  # house rule: no enum columns
# every ref target must be a declared Table (loop must print nothing)
for t in $(grep -oE 'ref: *[<>-]+ *[a-z0-9_]+\.' "$F" | grep -oE '[a-z0-9_]+\.' | tr -d '.' | sort -u); do
  grep -qE "^Table $t \{" "$F" || echo "ref target without table: $t"
done
```

### 6. Close out

After writing, report:

- The path written.
- A count of tables broken down as: domain tables, lookup tables, pivots.
- The coverage table from step 4 (Key Concept | Table(s)) — every concept persisted or noted as not persisted.
- Self-checks: all green — list any check that initially failed and how it was fixed (Red → Green).
- Any open questions still needing the developer's decision.
